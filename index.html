                            I moved to Veygo looking for a new challenge and a larger team to learn from. My role as a 
                            software engineer on the Tempcover squad has allowed me to broaden my knowledge to full stack.<br/><br/>
                            Working on a range of different services across the frontend and backend, I have the 
                            opportunity to write in Python and TypeScript, utiltising React, Docker and AWS. I have 
                            been able to develop my frontend skills and work with familiar languages but in a different 
                            context, further building on my development skills. I was able to gain a greater understanding 
                            of cloud infrastructure, utilising AWS rather than GCP, and am looking at furthering this learning 
                            by aiming on getting AWS certification.

                            My first permenant role upon completing my degree. As an associate software engineer, I formed
							a key part of the small, but growing, data engineering team within Aforza R&D.<br/><br/>
							Working mainly on REST APIs written in TypeScript utilising NodeJS, Docker and Kubernetes, 
							I gained skills and knowledge on development practices and languages. I was able 
							to develop a greater understanding of how software is built and deployed and the underlying 
							cloud infrastructure that is used to run it. I also took up every opportunity given to me to  
							look into the machine learning and big data side of our team's remit to further explore and 
							expand my skillset.<br/><br/>
							As part of my employment, I volunteered to be a fire marshall and first aider for the office. 
							I relished the opportunity to do something different and learn a life skill, whilst also helping
							the company meet all health and safety requiremnts.

                            I attained a first class degree in Computing Science at UEA in Norwich.<br/><br/>
                            During my first year, I attained a first class in all modules I took, with an average mark of
                            88%. First year modules included Programming 1, a module focussed on Java and programming
                            principles, Systems Development, focussing on the software development process and ethics. My
                            favourite module of the year was web-based programming as it allowed me to develop my web development
                            further, including using Python as opposed to PHP as a backend.<br/><br/>
                            In my second year, I again attained a first class in all modules I took, with an average mark of
                            81%. Architecture and Operating Systems was a particular challenging module during this year,
                            as it involved much lower level programming than I was used to, including using C and assembly
                            which I struggled to get my head around initially, but ended the module with a mark of 79%. Other
                            modules include Networks, which involved the protocols and practicalities of networking, and Software
                            Engineering 1, which looked at producing a product from start to finish using an agile development
                            methodology.<br/><br/>
							In my final year, I again attained a first class in all modules I took, with an average mark of
                            76%.

                            programme at the Met Office in Exeter. As a scientific software engineer (SSE), I was tasked
                            with producing scientific software in the Post-Processing and Verification Systems team within
                            the Weather Science Directorate.<br/><br/>
                            I gained valuable skills in Python development utilising a range of scientific libraries, both
                            internal and external, and working within a large scale development environment. I was able to
                            develop my team working and communication skills, regularly taking part in stand-ups, demos and
                            meetings, as well as getting an insight into the way a large scientific organisation works.

                            at Robot Mascot, an investment pitch agency, to develop my skills within an industry environment.
                            During my internship, I was tasked with developing a custom e-commerce website for a client using
                            a PHP backend along with a fellow intern.<br/><br/>
                            After my internship had ended, I was taken on part-time as a web developer. I continued to seek
                            out opportunities to grow my skill set, including WordPress development, utilising the Stripe and
                            Mailchimp APIs and server management.

                        <p>
                            Attom was an attendance tracking system designed to register and monitor the signing in and
                            out of sixth form students. The app was fully implemented at the saltash.net community
                            school sixth form for year 12 and 13, before being replaced by a fingerprint-based system
                            in 2017. It used NFC cards which were given to users and then swiped against an Android
                            tablet which used a native Android app to process the swipe and output a custom audio and
                            visual message to the user.<br/><br/>
                            Users of the app commented on its ease of use and its speed compared to the old paper
                            system, with almost 98% of students rating it good or outstanding as a system.

                        <p>
                            PRZE is a peer-to-peer and traditional praise system for the SECRET skills. The system was
                            used by year 7 students as part of their integrated learning curriculum and was also
                            displayed to both Hillcrest Christian College (Queensland, AUS) and SIVECO Romania, both
                            giving positive reviews of the software. Currently, a native Android app is in the late
                            stages of development, along with a web platform, all designed (including graphics),
                            developed and tested by myself. An Ubuntu server was set up by myself and run through
                            appropriate CDNs to ensure security and speed.<br/><br/>
                            The school commented on several occasions about the quick turn around time of developments
                            and professionalism throughout the planning, design, testing and evaluation phases of
                            development.

                            the semi-finals of the competition under the 'Should Exist' category. The website uses an
                            algorithm to compare Pokémon to see which Pokémon would best counter an enemy Pokémon,
                            and a feature which allows users to battle two Pokémon.
